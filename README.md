## End-to-End ML Pipeline for Predicting Student Performance
# The project predicted student marks by analyzing factors such as parental education, gender, ethnicity, etc
# After conducting a comparative analysis of ML models including Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost among others, an 88% accuracy was achieved using Linear Regression.
# Developed a prediction pipeline integrating the top-performing model and incorporating logging, exception handling while deploying the Flask web app with HTML frontend on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk
